# Python-Challenge
This project was composed of 2 parts that showcased my Python coding skills: PyBank and PyPoll <br>
<br>
Part 1: PyBank <br>
In PyBank, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. In order to do this I imported modules, read a CSV file, and used a for loop with conditionals to perform a series of calculations to print the results in proper format for the total number of months, net total amount of "Profit/Losses", changes in "Profit/Losses", average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits over the entire period. <br>
<br>
The Python script, CSV file, and results (text output) file can be found below:<br>

<br>
Part 2: PyPoll <br>
In PyPoll, I created a Python script to analyze election results for a small town. In order to this I utilized many of the skills from PyBank, with the addition of creating a list, counter, and dictionary. <br>
The Python script, CSV file, and results(text output) file can be found below:<br>
