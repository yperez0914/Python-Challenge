# Python-Challenge
This project was composed of 2 parts: PyBank and PyPoll <br>
<br>
In PyPoll, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. In order to do this I imported modules, read a CSV file, and used a for loop to perform a series of calculations and print the results for the total number of months, net total amount of "Profit/Losses", changes in "Profit/Losses", average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits over the entire period. <br>
<br>
The Python script, CSV file, and text (output) file can be found below:<br>
